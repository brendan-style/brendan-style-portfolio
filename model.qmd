title: "Home Run Betting Model"

This will be a publishing of my Home Run predictor model that I created for my
Data Analytics Capstone during my senior year of college. The model will, if given
information about a hitter's matchup, produce a rating. These ratings
carry with them a predicted percentage chance, and thus have predicted odds.
The "diff" category shows the difference in odds between my calculations and the
associated sportsbook. The higher the better, and I will be publishing the players
that have both the best odds to hit a home run, as well as the most percieved 
value by my model <br>

Some things to note: <br>

- Players season long stats will be updated every Thursday
- Hitters facing pitchers with insufficient data will be left off the list

### Coming Soon
- Weather Factors
- Stadium factors based on Pulled-FB rate

Here is the top 50 for ratings today, enjoy!
