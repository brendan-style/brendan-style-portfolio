This will be a publishing of my Home Run predictor model that I created for my
Data Analytics Capstone during my senior year of college. The model will, if given
information about a hitter's matchup, produce a rating. Eventually, these ratings
will be associated with a predicted percentage chance, and thus have predicted odds,
but currently these odds will not be present, as I do not yet have enough data to predict
those. In it's place we will have the odds assigned by FanDuel and DraftKings. 
Some things to note: <br>

- Players season long stats will be updated every Thursday
- Hitters facing pitchers with insufficient data will be left off the list

## Coming Soon
- Weather Factors
- Stadium factors based on Pulled-FB rate

Here is the top 50 for ratings today, enjoy!

data <- select(data, 'player','pitcher','away_team','home_team','rating',
               'FanDuel','DraftKings')
data <- data %>% arrange(desc(rating))
