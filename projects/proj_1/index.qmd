This will be a blog post recapping my findings from my project for Geneseo's
GREAT Day in 2024, as a part of my Data Visualization class

## Goals
When beginning this project, I had 3 questions I wanted to answer:

1. What impact does drafting have on overall team success?
2. What Impact does prior drafting success have on future drafting success?
3. How has the shift in NFL playstyle impacted overall draft strategy?

## Dataset Acquisition/Cleaning

Creation of the dataset was quite simple. Thanks to the draft library from *nfl-data-py*, I was able to load all NFL draft selections from 1980 onward into a python pandas dataframe.
