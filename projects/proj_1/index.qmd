This will be a blog post recapping my findings from my project for Geneseo's
GREAT Day in 2024, as a part of my Data Visualization Final Project.

## Goals
When beginning this project, I had 3 questions I wanted to answer:

1. What impact does drafting have on overall team success?
2. What Impact does prior drafting success have on future drafting success?
3. How has the shift in NFL playstyle impacted overall draft strategy?

## Dataset 

### Acquisition

Creation of the dataset was quite simple. Thanks to the draft library from *nfl-data-py*, I was able to load all NFL draft selections beginning in 1980 into a dataframe, which I have provided a snapshot of below.
```{r,echo =FALSE,message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/brend/Desktop/DANL-320/brendan-style.github.io/ds_try_2_WB.xlsx")
data <- select(data, 'season','round','pick','pfr_player_name','position', 'w_av')
knitr::kable(head(data, 20), row.names = FALSE)
```
All told this dataset comes in at well over 10,000 observations, and provides much more data about the players than what is shown above. Things like career stats/accolades, college attended, etc.

### Cleaning

Since this research is attempting to overall career value as the main metric, it would be unfair to incorperate recent draft classes, since they haven't had enough time to accrue a high enough overall career value. I picked the cutoff point as 2014, since, at the time, that meant that every player in the dataset had been drafted at least 10 seasons ago, which gave players enough time to rack up AV(approximate Value), which is Pro Football Reference's take on WAR, or Wins Above Replacement, commonly seen in baseball. It is by no means perfect, but in a game like football where discerning a player's lone contribution to the team is tricky to do, it is the best metric we have at our disposal. This left us with 9,647 players left to analyze.

It should also be noted that, for most of this analysis, I only included players who actually played a snap in the NFL. This removed almost 3000 more players from the dataset, leaving us with just over 6,500 obervations remaining.

### Standardizing wAV

As previously mentioned, I will be using PFR's Weighted Approximate Value (wAV) metric to determine draft pick success. However, there are issues with this metric, and chief among them is the fact that not all positions accrue value at the same rate. For example, if a Center has an All-Pro caliber year, they will probably be worth somewhere around 16 AV. However, that number is routinely passed by 4-6 QB's every year. Because of this, I decided to standardize every player's wAV realative to their position. In doing this, we achieve what can be considered to be a more fair way of evaluating players across different positions. Here's an example of how it works:

*Player X plays at a position where the average wAV for a player's career was 5, and the standard deviation is 2. If player X's wAV for his career is 9, then his standardized wAV would be 2.0, since his wAV is 4 higher than the average, which is 2 standard deviaitons.*

For a real world example, Peyton Manning (QB) and Zach Thomas (LB) had a dispairty of over 60 wAV between their career totals(176 vs 115). Using just that stat, you would think that Manning was far and beyond the better player, but according to their position-weighted standardized values, they were of equal relative value, both being rated at 3.67 standard deviations above their positional average. This means that Manning was of similar value to QB’s as Thomas was to LB’s.

Now, this still isn't a perfect measurement of a player's value. The main issue is that this metric tends to *undervalue* QB's as opposed to overvaluing. This is because QB's and other positions like TE that have a smaller pool of players to draw from, so outlier careers, such as Manning or Kelce, can significantly influence the overall mean for the position group. This explains why Rod Woodson, who was certainly one of the best DB's to ever play, is rated as far and beyond the most valuable player in NFL history by this new metric; he was a great player who had a long career, and did so at a position that sees more players take snaps than any other, meaning the positional mean is very low. For the entire sample, there were 341 drafted QB's who took a snap in the NFL, as opposed to 400 snap-taking DB's... **in the 80's alone**.

### Dummy Variables

Now that we have the position-agnostic swAV, or Standardized Weighted Approximate Value, we can create a set of dummy variables that can categorize a player's career. It is worth noting that, as the graph below indicates, there is a serious skew towards numbers between 0 and -1.

Because of this, if we want to create these dummy variables, we will have to do so based on our perception of average roster construction, which isn't an exact science. Nonetheless, here are the groupings we came up with:

- Bad: less than -0.70
- Below Average: -0.70 to -0.20
- Average: -0.20 to 0.70
- Above Average: 0.70 to 1.50
- Good: 1.5 to 2.5
- Great: over 2.5

These partitions created this distribution, which we believe to be a fair assessment of the average NFL roster:

Now that we have our new variables, we can finally dive into the analysis.

## Impact of Draft Success on Winning

In order to measure the correlation of draft success on team success, I took a team's total winning percentage for a given decade(1980's up to 2010's) and compared it to that team's average value for a draft pick over that same time, and these were the results:

![](draft_to_win_rate.png)

As you can see, there certainly is a correlation there, but not quite as high as initially expected, with a moderate Pearson correlation coefficient of just 0.30. This makes some sense when considering that players are not solely acquired from the draft, NFL organizations can also acquire players through free agency or via trading, but still a lower positive relation than what was expected.

After seeing these results, I thought that my initial process might have been unfairly punishing teams that accumulated more late round picks, a strategy that is overall good for team building, but greatly reduces the team's average draft pick value. In order to get around this, I decided to run a similar test to the last, but this time only use a team's top 5 picks from each draft, so that a team wouldn't be punished for having more selections. Here were the results of that comparison:

![](top5_win_rate.png)

Ultimately, there wasn't much of a change in correlation with this comparison, with this graph having a Pearson R-squared of 0.36, a marginal upgrade over the previous. Despite the draft being the easiest and most common venue by which NFL team's aquire players, there is nothing but a moderate correlation between their drafting success and on the field success.

## More Impactful: Late Round Success or Early Round Failure?

While researching the success of the draft on overall success, I came across an interesting discovery: The correlation between rounds 4-12 success and winning percentage was actually higher than the correlation between rounds 1-3 drafting success and winning percentage. This was surprising for a number of reasons; Not only do high round picks often become much more impactful players than later round picks(32.9% of all players drafted 1-3 become at least Above Average, as oppose to just under 10% for players drafted 4-12), but most teams also take extra care to select the most talented player available in the early rounds, whereas later rounds often see teams "reach" for players that fill a position of need. In order to investigate this further, I decided to create a pair of new dummy variables:

#### __Steal__

A "steal" is defined as a player whose value exceeds that of their expectations as defined by their draft position. To quantify it, we have used our dummy variables from earlier to come up with this definition:

- "Great" in round 2 or later
- "Good" in round 3 or later
- "Above Average" in round 4 or later
- "Average" in round 5 or later

#### __Whiff__

A “whiff” is the antithesis of a steal, being a player whose value falls short of their expectations, specifically:

- "Average" in round 1
- "Below Average" in round 2
- "Bad" in round 3

With these new variables, we can compare the occurrence of these variables with the teams winning percentage to see which has a larger impact on a team's success.

#### First, we have impact of Whiffs on success:

![](whiffs_per_draft.png)

#### Then we have Steals on success:

![](steals_per_draft.png)

As you can see from the whiffs graph, there is virtually no correlation between missing on early-round picks and games won. The r-squared value, which would be expected to have a negative relationship, actually shows a slight *positive* relationship of 0.07, so we can confidently say that missing on early round picks has little to no impact on success. While the steals graph may not look that much better, there is a far higher correlation of 0.41.

This test firmly states that finding solid but not spectacular players in later rounds helps winning more so than drafting mediocre or bad players with valuable early round picks hurts it. These results reinforce the idea that many football analysts have come around to in recent years: The notion that trading higher value picks away for more chance to select players with less valuable picks, as more selections gives you a greater chance to find a "diamond in the rough", so to speak. In a world where many believe that predicting which college players will be good NFL players is far harder than most give it credit for, quantity of picks can be just as, if not **more** valuable than quality of picks.
